        QEMU-arma9 Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document contains common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemuarma9 layer
----------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this BSP is targeted at a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to load the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ make start-target


3.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

By default, the guest system running in QEMU runs NFS rootfs.

3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
---------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'd initramfs image with:

$ make bbs
$ bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs
$ exit

The resulting file can be found at export/qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz


3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

Pass the run-time option "-initrd" in TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to use the
initramfs image as a ram disk, as shown in the example below.

And use the 'root=/dev/ram' kernel command line option. For example, run the following 
command in the project directory to run the guest in QEMU using initrd:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS="-initrd `pwd`/export/qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz -M vexpress-a9" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/ram

Note: We need to make use of TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to specify '-M <machine_type>' option
for qemu. 


3.3 Virtual Disk on Qemu
------------------------

3.3.1 Create virtual disk image
-------------------------------

Add the '--enable-bootimage=ext3' option when configuring the project with the
configure command as shown below:

.../wrlinux/configure --enable-bootimage=ext3 \
--enable-kernel=standard \
--enable-rootfs=glibc_small --enable-board=qemuarma9 ...

Or:

Edit <projectDir>/local.conf manually, ensuring that it contains the line below:

IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext3"

Then run 'make fs' again. After 'make fs' completes, you can find the virtual
disk image at:

<projectDir>/images/qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-<rootfs type>-<kernel type>-dist.ext3

Eg. qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3

3.3.2 Deployment
------------------

Run the below command to get MMC disk image bootup.

$ make start-target TOPTS="-disk $PWD/export/qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3" \
	TARGET_VIRT_BOOT_TYPE=disk


3.4 Simics Support
------------------

The BSP can run on Simics Cortex-A9 model.

For booting on Simics, dtb file has to be specified explicitly in the
"make start-simics" commandline by the below:
TARGET_SIMICS_DTB=vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

3.4.1 MMC Root
--------------

Simics Cortex-A9 model supports MMC card.

Assuming the ext3 rootfs image has been generated by follwoing the above
instructions.

For example, run the following command in the project directory:
$ make start-simics TOPTS="-disk $PWD/export/qemuarma9-wrlinux-image-glibc-small-standard-dist.ext3" \
	TARGET_VIRT_BOOT_TYPE=disk
	TARGET_VIRT_BOOT_TYPE=disk TARGET_SIMICS_DTB=vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

An alternative approach to generate virtual disk image and bootup commands
are the below:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=bootdisk bs=1 count=0 seek=3892314112
$ ./scripts/fakestart.sh ./host-cross/sbin/mke2fs -F -t ext3 \
   -d export/dist bootdisk
$ make start-simics TOPTS="-disk bootdisk" TARGET_VIRT_BOOT_TYPE=disk \
	TARGET_SIMICS_DTB=vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

3.4.2 Initramfs
---------------

For the initramfs boot, the below can be done:

The following command will generate a rootfs from export/dist
$ make start-simics TARGET_SIMICS_BUILD_INITRD_PLUS=1
The following command will start the system from the initramfs
$ make start-simics TARGET_VIRT_BOOT_TYPE=custom \
        TARGET_VIRT_IP=none \
        TARGET_SIMICS_INITRD=`pwd`/initrd \
        EX_TARGET_SIMICS_KERNEL_OPTS="rdinit=/sbin/init" \
        TARGET_SIMICS_DTB=vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

3.4.3 Known Issue
-----------------

Due to Simics model emulation issue, NFS root filesystem runs very slowly.


4. Target Notes
===============

4.1 OProfile
============
This BSP does not have a usable implementation of hardware performance
counters, so OProfile must be used in timer mode. If you are
using OProfile you need to add "oprofile.timer=1" to your kernel boot
options.
