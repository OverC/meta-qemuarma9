        QEMU-arma9 Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document describes the common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemuarma9 layer
----------------------------
This layer and wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel branch. For example:

  # cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this is targeted to a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to run the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ make start-target


3.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

By default, the GUEST system running in QEMU is using NFS rootfs.

3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
---------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'ed initramfs image with:

$ make bbs
$ bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs
$ exit

The resulting file is export/qemuarma9-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz.


3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

Pass the run-time option "-initrd" in TARGET_QEMU_OPTS to use the
initramfs image as ram disk, as shown in the example below.

And use the 'root=/dev/ram' kernel command line option.

For example, run the following command in the project directory to
run the Guest in QEMU using initrd:

$ make start-target \
TARGET_QEMU_OPTS="-initrd `pwd`/export/qemuarma9-glibc-small-standard-dist.cpio.gz -M vexpress-a9" \
TARGET_QEMU_KERNEL_OPTS=root=/dev/ram

Note, compare versus qemux86, we need to make use of TARGET_QEMU_OPTS
to specify '-M <machine_type>' option for qemu. Here we need to pick
it up as well.


4. Target Notes
===============

4.1 OProfile
============
This BSP does not have a usable implementation of hardware performance
counters, so OProfile must fall back to be used in timer mode. If you are
using OProfile you need to add "oprofile.timer=1" to your kernel boot
options.
